## 👋 Hello

I'm **Junghyun Nam (rkttu)**, a software engineer, technical writer, and community builder.

I've been solving complex problems and designing architectures that create business value, primarily based on the Microsoft technology stack. Beyond writing code, I believe in the power of **'connection'** — sharing knowledge and growing together.

This blog is a space where I document the technical depths I've explored and the insights I've gained from the community.

## 🚀 Professional Experience

> *"I solve problems with code and share knowledge through writing."*

I specialize in **C#** and the .NET ecosystem, as well as building cloud-native environments with Microsoft Azure. With hands-on experience at companies like Megazone Cloud and Devsisters, I design stable and efficient systems.

- **Microsoft MVP** — Active since 2009, recognized for continuous technical sharing and contributions.
- **Technical Writing** — I strive to write content that makes technical concepts accessible.

## 🤝 Community

> *"Technology grows in value the more you share it."*

I dream of an ecosystem where we grow together rather than alone.

- **[DotNetDev](https://forum.dotnetdev.kr)** Organizer — Running Korea's largest .NET developer community, creating a space for developer communication and knowledge exchange.
