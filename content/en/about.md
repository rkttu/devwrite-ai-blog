I've been solving complex problems and designing architectures that create business value, primarily based on the Microsoft technology stack. Beyond writing code, I believe in the power of **'connection'** — sharing knowledge and growing together.

This blog is a space where I document the technical depths I've explored and the insights I've gained from the community.
