## Welcome!

This is the first post on my Hugo-powered blog.

### What is Hugo?

Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. It offers fast build speeds and supports various themes.

### Next Steps

- Write more posts
- Customize the theme
- Deploy

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Hugo!")
}
```

Happy blogging! 🚀
